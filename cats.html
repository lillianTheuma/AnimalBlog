        <p><em>Dear Blog, I am a cat. It's December 22, 1805. I found a bird, and also a tree. I dug up a stick, and then buried it a few feet away. Today was highly productive.</em></p>

        <p><em>Dear Blog, I am a cat. Today I joined the soviet offensive in eastern Europe. I made many friends, including a German prisoner named Darth Vader. I bagged 3 stukas, and took 250 pounds of gold for the motherland. I am grateful for the party for allowing me to serve, despite being a literal cat.</em></p>
