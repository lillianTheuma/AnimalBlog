    <h2>Fun Facts about Dogs:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Dogs do not appear in the 2016 animated film <strong><em>Zootopia</em></strong>. This is because dogs were selectively bred from wolves <em>by humans</em>, and humans never existed in the world of Zootopia.</li>
      <li>Contrary to popular belief, dogs do not just see in black and white. Their color spectrum is similar to the red-green colorblindness found in humans. They see the world in shades of yellow and blue!</li>
      <li>All dogs are good dogs!</li>
    </ol>
